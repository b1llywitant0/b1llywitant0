👋 Hi there! My name is Billy Witanto.

💼 I am data analyst based in Jakarta, Indonesia. I am currently working in retail jewelry industry, specifically in digital marketing division.

👨‍🔬 Fun fact! I was a life science researcher for 3.5 years who focused on studying the pathogenesis of Hepatitis B virus. In the emergence of COVID-19 period, I was given the opportunity to work with COVID-19 in Biosafety Lab-3 facility which used astronout-like lab equipment to protect myself from the virus, just like in the zombie movie. 

❓ Well, if you ask why I changed job, the truth answer is because of there is no statistically significant correlation between the importance of the job and the salary in academia with p-value > 0.05 (lol, 😆). Other than that, there were other multiple factors like unstable political environment in Indonesia, etc. Well, long story short, I need to change my job to fill my stomach. But, if you ask me whether I want to change job, truthfully, I don't want to. It was my dream job, after all. 

✨ The hardest struggle was to find the most suitable job for me. After a long consideration, I made a realization that the backbone of research is the data. I also realize that I am most fascinated by the brainstorming process in research, not the lab work. Thus, I made the decision to be a data analyst with the quality of a researcher.

🌱 Now, I am interested in solving problems by giving actionable insights, whichever the industry is. Like a new bud, I am still searching for learning opportunity in a lot of domains, especially in data science field. For now, my focus is on how to optimize the funnel conversion in digital marketing channels: ads, website, SEO, and social media.
