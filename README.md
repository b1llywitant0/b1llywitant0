👋 Hi there! My name is Billy Witanto.

💼 I am data analyst based in Jakarta, Indonesia. I am currently working in retail jewelry industry, specifically in digital marketing division.

👨‍🔬 Fun fact! I was a life science researcher for 3.5 years who focused on studying the pathogenesis of Hepatitis B virus. In the emergence of COVID-19 period, I was given the opportunity to work with COVID-19 in Biosafety Lab-3 facility which used astronout-like lab equipment to protect myself from the virus, just like in the zombie movie. 

❓ Well, if you ask why I changed job, the truth answer is because of there is no statistically significant correlation between the importance of job and salary in academia with p-value > 0.05 (lol, 😆).

✨ The hardest struggle was to find the most suitable job for me. After a long consideration,
